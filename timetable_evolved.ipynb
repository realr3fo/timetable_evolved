    "- One teacher cannot give two courses at the same time\n",
    "- A set of students cannot have two classes at the same time\n",
    "- A teacher cannot teach more than maximum allotted hours.\n",

    "### Soft constraints\n",
    "These constraints that are not mandatory for a solution must be pursued, but the quality of the courses schedule is decided by following these constraints\n",
    "- In the timetable of teacher, no more than two lectures a day, each one 1 hours and 30 minutes, breaks are preferred 30 minutes or more.\n",
    "- In the students' timetable, we have to put three lectures a day at maximum with 30 minutes breaks between lectures so that they have more time for self-study at home\n",
    "- We must ensure that a group of students does not have to attend school only to attend one class, there has to be a maximum of three classes in a day and a minimum of two classes so that it will be worth it to come to college on a particular day"
